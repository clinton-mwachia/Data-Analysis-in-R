## Loading the data and packages

    We are going to predict the red wine quality using svm. this is going to be classification problem, if the quality of wine is >= 7 we are going to classify as good quality else bad.
    
```{r data and packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(DataExplorer)

wine_quality <- read_csv('data/winequality-red.csv')
summary(wine_quality)
str(wine_quality)
```

## Analysis eg NA ...

```{r Analysis}
# handling NA values
colSums(is.na(wine_quality))
# plotting NA values
plot_missing(wine_quality)

```
